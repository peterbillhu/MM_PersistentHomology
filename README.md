# How to use the codes?

## To generate the 100 iterations
Please execute the Matlab m file named by ``Test_100_Iterations``. Because of the copyright issue, in this code, we only generate the result for the Matlab function ``denoiseImage`` and ours. If you want to test other algorithms, please download the corresponding Matlab m files and put them into the root folder of the project.
